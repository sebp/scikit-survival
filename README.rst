scikit-survival
***************

scikit-survival is a Python module for `survival analysis`_
built on top of `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_. It allows doing survival analysis
while utilizing the power of scikit-learn, e.g., for pre-processing or doing cross-validation.

=======================
About Survival Analysis
=======================

The objective in `survival analysis`_ (also referred to as time-to-event or reliability analysis)
is to establish a connection between covariates and the time of an event.
What makes survival analysis differ from traditional machine learning is the fact that
parts of the training data can only be partially observed – they are *censored*.

For instance, in a clinical study, patients are often monitored for a particular time period,
and events occurring in this particular period are recorded.
If a patient experiences an event, the exact time of the event can
be recorded – the patient’s record is uncensored. In contrast, right censored records
refer to patients that remained event-free during the study period and
it is unknown whether an event has or has not occurred after the study ended.
Consequently, survival analysis demands for models that take
this unique characteristic of such a dataset into account.
