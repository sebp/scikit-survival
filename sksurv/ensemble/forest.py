class RandomSurvivalForest(_BaseSurvivalForest):
    """A random survival forest.

    A random survival forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of
    survival trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses
    averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample
    size but the samples are drawn with replacement if
    `bootstrap=True` (default).

    In each survival tree, the quality of a split is measured by the
    log-rank splitting rule.

    See the :ref:`User Guide </user_guide/random-survival-forest.ipynb>`,
    [1]_ and [2]_ for further description.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer, optional, default: 100
        The number of trees in the forest.

    max_depth : int or None, optional, default: None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional, default: 6
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional, default: 3
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional, default: 0.
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional, default: None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional, default: None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional, default: True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole datset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, default: False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate
        the generalization accuracy.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default: None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).

    verbose : int, optional, default: 0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, optional, default: False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    max_samples : int or float, optional, default: None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of SurvivalTree instances
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    event_times_ : array of shape = (n_event_times,)
        Unique time points where events occurred.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during ``fit``.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during ``fit``. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    oob_score_ : float
        Concordance index of the training dataset obtained
        using an out-of-bag estimate.

    See also
    --------
    sksurv.tree.SurvivalTree
        A single survival tree.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    Compared to scikit-learn's random forest models, :class:`RandomSurvivalForest`
    currently does not support controlling the depth of a tree based on the log-rank
    test statistics or it's associated p-value, i.e., the parameters
    `min_impurity_decrease` or `min_impurity_split` are absent.
    In addition, the `feature_importances_` attribute is not available.
    It is recommended to estimate feature importances via
    `permutation-based methods <https://eli5.readthedocs.io>`_.

    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,
    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement
    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the
    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behavior during
    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

class ExtraSurvivalTrees(_BaseSurvivalForest):
    """An extremely random survival forest.

    This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized
    survival trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples of the dataset
    and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control
    over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original
    input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if
    `bootstrap=True` (default).

    In each randomized survival tree, the quality of a split is measured by
    the log-rank splitting rule.

    Compared to :class:`RandomSurvivalForest`, randomness goes one step
    further in the way splits are computed. As in
    :class:`RandomSurvivalForest`, a random subset of candidate features is
    used, but instead of looking for the most discriminative thresholds,
    thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best of
    these randomly-generated thresholds is picked as the splitting rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer, optional, default: 100
        The number of trees in the forest.

    max_depth : int or None, optional, default: None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional, default: 6
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional, default: 3
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional, default: 0.
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional, default: None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional, default: None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional, default: True
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole datset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, default: False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate
        the generalization accuracy.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default: None
        Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
        when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
        features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
        (if ``max_features < n_features``).

    verbose : int, optional, default: 0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, optional, default: False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    max_samples : int or float, optional, default: None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of SurvivalTree instances
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    event_times_ : array of shape = (n_event_times,)
        Unique time points where events occurred.

    n_features_in_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during ``fit``. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    oob_score_ : float
        Concordance index of the training dataset obtained
        using an out-of-bag estimate.
